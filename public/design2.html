            <p>This was a project that I created for A Level Computer Science, that consisted of physical devices as
              well as a range of software devices that I created to control a rover remotely from anywhere.</p><br>
            <p>I created this project as a proof of concept to allow people with mobility issues to 'go out' and explore
              the areas, not only close to them but around the world, due to the nature of the internet and
              ever-expanding IOT devices. For this project, I created a web server, control platform, credential
              manager, client and proxy.</p><br>
            <p>This project scored 74/75 (A*) and can be found here: <a

            <p>For this Project, I created a simple landing page for any person that chooses to access aylo.net.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I wanted to keep this page free from clutter and wanted it to be professional and include only the
              relevant information so that in the case that a future employer or client were to look at this site, they
              would have no abiguity on where to look at some of my previous work or on how to contact me.</p><br>

          Livestream Overlay (External Client)

            <p>I was approached by a group of study livestreamers to create a bespoke interactive overlay that they
              could use to improve the viewer's experience as well as overall information availablity.</p><br>
            <p>To allow for live, realtime information to be shown, I created an API platform that the calendar client,
              background client and streamer dashboard can connect to and interact not only with one another, but other
              APIs as well, such at LastFM, StreamLabs and Google Calendar to get other information from outside of my
              systems.</p><br>
            <p>To get the best reliability as well as ease of distrubution, I chose to host the API using secure web
              sockets, so that all clients can have the same information as soon as it is available.</p>
